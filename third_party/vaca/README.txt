 What is Vaca?
===============

This directory contains some code that is an attempt to merge Jinete
source code (the original ASE GUI library which uses Allegro) and Vaca
library (a Win32 wrapper).

Some of this code should be merge to Vaca trunk in the near future.
See Vaca home page for more information:
