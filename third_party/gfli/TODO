Important:
- add LC2 chunk saving
- enhance PDB/GUI interface:
  - get header info (width/height/number of frames)
  - load only a specified range of frames
  - load single frame
  - set parameters, like frames per second or aspect ratio

Not-that-important:
- add support for MIDI or text information, see README
- write a small FLI/FLC player
- on-the-fly conversion to RGB
