For next release
----------------

+ Add a flag (compiler flag or a flag in gui.xml) to set fullscreen
  mode as the default one (for special devices where fullscreen is
  preferred).
+ Add IntEntry class in src/gui/ with spin-buttons.
+ Add feedback to "Shift+S" shortcut to switch "snap to grid".
+ Fix palette editor to avoid generating a lot of consecutive Undo actions.
+ Convert jaccel::key_list to std::vector<>
+ Integrate "copy & paste" loop with selection moving loop.
+ Shade drawing mode.
+ Export/Import sprite sheets.
+ Rethink the color-bar to show the full palette and a RGB gradient.
+ Sort palette entries.
+ Add "Remap" button to palette editor after a palette entry is modified:
  This button should apply a color curve to the whole sprite to remap
  old indexes to the new positions. 
+ Support for non-zero index entries as transparent in Indexed sprites.
+ Move launcher.cpp to base/ lib adding an extension point for "gui" lib.
+ Remove src/dialogs/repo,playfli,drawtext.
+ Move src/dialogs/aniedit,filesel to src/widgets (remove dialogs/ directory).
+ Merge everything related to configuration/settings in one class
  (allow configuration per document). Use cfg.cpp and settings/ dir.
+ Refactor src/file/ in several layers.

Refactoring
-----------

- About Signals/Slots: Add some field in slots to avoid disconnecting
  them from dead signals.
- Eradicate JList.
- Replace JRect & jrect with gfx::Rect.
- Create gfx::Region to replace JRegion & jregion.
- editors_ -> MultiEditors class widget
- convert all widgets to classes:
  + match Jinete design with Vaca library.
  + move all functions (jwidget_*) to methods in Widget class.
  + the same for each widget (e.g. jbutton_* to Button widget)
  + AppHooks to Vaca::Signals
  + Convert all JI_SIGNAL to base::Signals
- all member functions should be named verbNoun instead of verb_noun or noun_verb.
- all functions to handle an object should be converted to member functions:
  - e.g. jwidget_set_text -> Widget::setText

High priority work
------------------

+ Selection tools do not have "move" functionality incorporated yet as we talked (they just add/subtract selection)
+ The following tools do not work: scroll, move.
- Fix paste behavior:
  + paste when there are no images (create one image or put the
    clipboard as the layer's image)
  + create a 'floating' flag for image-layers and make the
    trasformation embedded in the editor
  + Ctrl+T should transform the current cel
- fix bilinear: when getpixel have alpha = 0 get a neighbor color.
- fix sliders in Tools Configuration, they are too big
  for small resolutions.
- rewrite palette-editor to edit multiple-palettes.
  - fix quantize (one palette for all frames, one palette per frame)
  - pal-operations (sort, quantize, gamma by color-curves, etc.);
  - complete palette operations, and palette editor (it needs a slider
    or something to move between palette changes)
- if there is activated the Tools Configuration dialog box, the
  Shift+G and Shift+S should update it
- add two DrawClick2:
  - DrawClick2FreeHand
  - DrawClick2Shape
- see the new Allegro's load_font
- finish ICO files support.
- add "size" to GUI font (for TTF fonts);
- layer movement between sets in animation-editor;
  + add all the "set" stuff again;
- fix algo_ellipsefill;
- view_tiled() should support animation playback (partial support:
  with left and right keys).

Wish-list
---------

- dacap wish-list:
  + added starred file-items in the file-selector.
- manuq wish-list:
  + layer-with-constant-cel
- Mateusz Czaplinski ideas:
  + when move selections, will be good the possibility to see relative
    position from the starting point of movement;
  + make drawing the 'marching-ants-rectangle' a prioritaire thing to
    draw (when move it).

Low priority stuff
------------------

- add unit-tests for "raster" and file formats.
- test routines: load/save_pic_file, load/save_msk_file,
  load/save_col_file.
- fix the fli reader (both Allegro and Gfli): when a frame hasn't
  chunks means that it's looks like the last frame;
- talk with Elias Pschernig, his "do_ellipse_diameter" (algo_ellipse)
  has a bug with ellipses of some dimensions (I made a test, and a
  various sizes have errors).
- optimize the *_to_allegro image methods (I profiled ASE, and these
  are the more slow routines in all the program);
- remove the jquickmenu.c
