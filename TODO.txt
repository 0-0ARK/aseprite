High priority work
------------------

- search for TODO;
- remove the jfilesel.c
- fix the sprite-properties dialog when select the constant
  frame length.
- fix copyright years (2001-2008)
- fix a bug in the film editor when move the separator (panel) outside
  the screen (to left or right)
  + rewrite the film editor.
- 'jfile.c' should use 'jxml.c', because there are duplicate code:
  two (precarious) XML parsers.
- ver por el nuevo load_font de Allegro.
- complete palette operations, and palette editor (it needs a slider
  or something to move between palette changes);
- fix undo of big chunks (more than limit):
  + how to reproduce the error? create an RGB image of 800x600, add a
    layer, add a frame, move the new frame to the other layer, undo,
    there is the bug.
- fix quantize (one palette for all frames, one palette per frame)
- fix Jinete examples:
  + 05fsel
  + 09lists
  + 20combo
  + 21manage
+ finished the support for ICO files.
- add "size" to GUI font (for TTF fonts);
- layer movement between sets in filmeditor;
  + add all the "set" stuff again;
- quick swap;
  + the regions mustn't be overlapped;
- options to change the curve type (in curedit.c);
- More Commands:
  + resize sprite;
  + rotate sprite;
  + canvas size;
- gauss blur;
- pal-operations (sort, quantize, gamma by color-curves, etc.);
- RGB and HSV effects;
- color-curve stock;
- fix algo_ellipsefill;
- view_tiled() should support animation playback (partial support:
  with left and right keys).
- when press Plus/Minus pad in the editor and the configuration tool
  window is active, the slider of the "Brush Size" must be updated.
- make keys like 9, 0, + Pad, - Pad configurable.
- drawing tools:
  + real-spray;
  + Animator Pro like: oval, petal, rpoly, star, poly, spiral;

Wish-list
---------

- dacap wish-list:
  + better film editor
    + rewrite it in one widget.
    + "middle mouse button" for the film editor.
  + added starred file-items in the file-selector.
- manuq wish-list:
  + layer-with-constant-cel
- Mateusz Czaplinski ideas:
  + when move selections, will be good the possibility to see relative
    position from the starting point of movement;
  + make drawing the 'marching-ants-rectangle' a prioritaire thing to
    draw (when move it).

Low priority stuff
------------------

- add more unit-tests.
- test routines: load/save_pic_file, load/save_msk_file,
  load/save_col_file.
- fix the fli reader (both Allegro and Gfli): when a frame hasn't
  chunks means that it's looks like the last frame;
- talk with Ben Davis, his "quantize.c" has memory leaks (test it
  more, I don't think so);
- talk with Elias Pschernig, his "do_ellipse_diameter" (algo_ellipse)
  has a bug with ellipses of some dimensions (I made a test, and a
  various sizes have errors).
- optimize the *_to_allegro image methods (I profiled ASE, and these
  are the more slow routines in all the program);
