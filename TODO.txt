High priority work
------------------

- search for TODO;
- tooltips for color-bar.
  + agregar soporte para UNDO al cambiar los colores de la paleta.
- add AseContext structure to handle the current state of the
  application (and hook changes in the context/options):
  + src/ase/ directory
  + src/ase/context.[ch]
  + the current sprite should be in the AseContext
  + the commands should be enabled/disabled/checked by the current
    context state
  + the commands should use a new ase/ API and not the raster/ low-level
  + the dependencies should be:
    commands/ -> ase/ -> raster/ -> jinete/
  + the list of 'sprites' should be in the context (maybe a
    AseSharedContext).
  + the scripts should start with a new default AseContext (but
    with the AseSharedContext visible)
  + 
- brush options by tool.
- if there is activated the Tools Configuration dialog box, the
  Shift+G and Shift+S should update it
  + Solution: with hooks and Options (add core/options.[ch])
- add a consistent error handling.
- rewrite the film editor.
- rewrite tools-inks-drawingmode stuff;
- new animation editor (remove the film editor)
- drag & drop files in Windows.
- add core/options & the Options structure.
- add two DrawClick2:
  - DrawClick2FreeHand
  - DrawClick2Shape
- remove the jfilesel.c
- fix the sprite-properties dialog when select the constant
  frame length.
- ver por el nuevo load_font de Allegro.
- complete palette operations, and palette editor (it needs a slider
  or something to move between palette changes);
- fix undo of big chunks (more than limit):
  + how to reproduce the error? create an RGB image of 800x600, add a
    layer, add a frame, move the new frame to the other layer, undo,
    there is the bug.
- fix quantize (one palette for all frames, one palette per frame)
- fix Jinete examples:
  + 05fsel
  + 09lists
  + 20combo
  + 21manage
+ finished the support for ICO files.
- add "size" to GUI font (for TTF fonts);
- layer movement between sets in filmeditor;
  + add all the "set" stuff again;
- quick swap;
  + the regions mustn't be overlapped;
- options to change the curve type (in curedit.c);
- More Commands:
  + resize sprite;
  + rotate sprite;
  + canvas size;
- gauss blur;
- pal-operations (sort, quantize, gamma by color-curves, etc.);
- RGB and HSV effects;
- color-curve stock;
- fix algo_ellipsefill;
- view_tiled() should support animation playback (partial support:
  with left and right keys).
- when press Plus/Minus pad in the editor and the configuration tool
  window is active, the slider of the "Brush Size" must be updated.
- make keys like 9, 0, + Pad, - Pad configurable.

Wish-list
---------

- dacap wish-list:
  + added starred file-items in the file-selector.
- manuq wish-list:
  + layer-with-constant-cel
- Mateusz Czaplinski ideas:
  + when move selections, will be good the possibility to see relative
    position from the starting point of movement;
  + make drawing the 'marching-ants-rectangle' a prioritaire thing to
    draw (when move it).

Low priority stuff
------------------

- add more unit-tests.
- test routines: load/save_pic_file, load/save_msk_file,
  load/save_col_file.
- fix the fli reader (both Allegro and Gfli): when a frame hasn't
  chunks means that it's looks like the last frame;
- talk with Ben Davis, his "quantize.c" has memory leaks (test it
  more, I don't think so);
- talk with Elias Pschernig, his "do_ellipse_diameter" (algo_ellipse)
  has a bug with ellipses of some dimensions (I made a test, and a
  various sizes have errors).
- optimize the *_to_allegro image methods (I profiled ASE, and these
  are the more slow routines in all the program);
