========================================
 What platforms are supported?
========================================

 You should be able to compile ASE successfully on the following
 platforms:

 - Windows + MSVC 2008 Express + DirectX SDK
 - Linux + GCC
 - Mac OS X


========================================
 How can I compile ASE?
========================================

The new build system for ASE is CMake (http://www.cmake.org/).
The following are the steps to compile ASE (in this case we
have the source code in a directory called "ase-source-dir"):

1) Make a build directory to leave all the files that are result of
   the compilation process (.exe, .lib, .obj, .a, .o, etc).

     C:\...\>cd ase-source-dir
     C:\...\ase-source-dir>mkdir build

   In this way, if you want to start with a fresh copy of ASE source
   code, you can remove the "build" directory and start again.

2) Enter in the new directory and execute cmake giving to it
   your compiler as generator:

     C:\...\ase-source-dir>cd build

   If you have nmake (MSVC compilers):
     C:\...\ase-source-dir\build>cmake .. -G "NMake Makefiles"

   If you have Visual Studio you can generate a solution:
     C:\...\ase-source-dir\build>cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 8 2005"
     C:\...\ase-source-dir\build>cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 9 2008"
     C:\...\ase-source-dir\build>cmake .. -G "Visual Studio 10"

   If you are on Linux:
     /.../ase-source-dir/build$ cmake .. -G "Unix Makefiles"

   If you have MinGW+MSYS:
     C:\...\ase-source-dir\build>cmake .. -G "MSYS Makefiles"

   If you have MinGW+mingw-make:
     C:\...\ase-source-dir\build>cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"

   For more information see:
     http://www.vtk.org/Wiki/CMake_Generator_Specific_Information

3) After you have executed one of the "cmake .. -G <generator>"
   commands, you have to compile the project executing make, nmake,
   opening the solution, etc.

4) When the project is compiled, you can copy "build/src/aseprite.exe"
   file to "ase-source-dir" and execute it. If you have used a Visual
   Studio project, you can copy the whole "data/" directory to
   "build/src/RelWithDebInfo/" so you can run/debug the program
   from Visual Studio IDE.
